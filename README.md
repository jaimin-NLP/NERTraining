## About the Project

This repository provides a framework for training NER models using various datasets and model architectures. It includes customizable options for pre-processing data, training NER models, and assessing their performance, allowing users to adapt the code to different languages and domains.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use this project, ensure you have Python 3.7+ and `pip` installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jaimin-NLP/NERTraining.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd NERTraining
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Training the Model

To train an NER model with the default configuration, run:

```bash
python train.py --config configs/default_config.json
```

You can customize the training parameters by modifying the configuration file (`configs/default_config.json`).

### Evaluating the Model

To evaluate a trained model, use the following command:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path models/your_model.pth --data_path data/evaluation_data.json
```

Replace `your_model.pth` with the path to your trained model file and `evaluation_data.json` with the path to your evaluation dataset.

## Features

- **Support for Multiple Datasets**: Easily integrate different datasets for NER tasks.
- **Configurable Training Parameters**: Adjust model architecture, batch size, learning rate, and more via configuration files.
- **Extensibility**: Code structure allows for easy customization and addition of new datasets or model architectures.
- **Evaluation Tools**: Built-in tools to evaluate the performance of trained models.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project. To contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Open a pull request.
